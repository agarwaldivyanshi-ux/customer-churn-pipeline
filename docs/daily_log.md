# Daily Log - Customer Churn DS Pipeline Project

### 📅 Day 1 - Setup (Nov 6, 2025)
- Installed Git and set up VS Code.
- Created project structure and initialized Git repository.
- Added `.gitignore` and pushed first commit to GitHub.
- Learned how to navigate folders and commit properly.

🧠 Reflection:
Got familiar with terminal commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `git add`, `git commit`).
Faced minor setup issues but resolved them independently — feeling more confident!

🎯 Next Steps:
- Add professional README.md.
- Start setting up the Python environment and explore sample datasets.

### 📅 Day 2 - Foundations & Revision (Nov 8, 2025)
- Starting; checking repo sync
- Verified GitHub sync successfully.
- Created first Jupyter notebook and ran basic cleaning.
- Understood `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull()`, and `.drop_duplicates()`.

- Spent time brushing basic python essentials. Confident!
- Updated README.md with project overview and progress so far. Excited!

🎯 Next Steps: learn data filtering and feature selection. EDA and visual exploration.
