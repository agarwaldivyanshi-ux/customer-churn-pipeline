# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

### 👩‍💻 Author: Divyanshi  
**Goal:** Build an end-to-end data science pipeline from raw data ingestion to model deployment.  

---

## 📍 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world data science workflow to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business.  
It covers:
- Data ingestion and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Deployment using FastAPI + Docker  
- Automation with Airflow  
- Experiment tracking with MLflow  

---

## 🏗️ Current Progress
- ✅ **Day 1:** Git setup, folder structure, repo initialization  
- ✅ **Day 2:** Environment setup, pandas practice, data cleaning basics  
- 🔜 **Day 3:** EDA on sample dataset + feature analysis
